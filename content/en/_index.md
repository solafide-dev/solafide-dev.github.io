Simple Worship is built by a community of Christians who want to use their tallents to serve Christ and His Church, with a particular focus on serving church plants, while being feature rich enough for the largest congregations.

We are also giant nerds who help run our churches technology, and we hate closed source software that we can't modify to fit our needs.

With that goal in mind, we have some core philosophies that guide our development.
