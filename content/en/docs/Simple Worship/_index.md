SimpleWorship is a free, open source, church presentation software.

The end goal here  is a simple, easy to use, and free church presentation software that is cheap to deploy, pluggable for easy extensibility, and easy to use for volunteers to might not be as tech savvy.

## Our Motivation

This project was started for two main reasons:

- We were tired of walled garden, proprietary and hard to interact with software for churches.
  - As the "technology people" at our churches, we want to be able to automate and simplify workflows, and make it extremely easy for volenteers to
    use the software.
  - We wanted flexibility and cost savings whenever possible, not relying on proprietary software to have the feature we want, but instead having the ability to, with a little time, add it ourselves.
- We felt compelled to use our tallents to serve the local church, and this is one way we can do that.
